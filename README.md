SHORT DESCRIPTION:


Problem definition:

Singapore is currently facing an increasing ageing population, caused by increased life expectancy and decreasing birth rates. As a result, there has a steady increase in the vulnerable populations in recent times. Additionally, there has been an increasing trend of elderly with no next on kin to attend to their needs, putting the vulnerable populations at risk of accidents. Hence, it is important to
increase awareness at the onset of incidents which require emergency response and mobilise CFRs for early intervention in order to mitigate the extent of such accidents.


How technology can help?

The use of wearable technology and/or sensors can be used to monitor vital signs or movements of the elderly around the house. In the event that there is an anomaly detected in the data collected, a CFR would be alerted to check on the well-being of the elderly.
